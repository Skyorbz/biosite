    <h2>THE BEGINNING</h2>
    <p>My mothers’ name is Mary Anita Branch Tripp-Harris. She was born in Cary Mississippi. Over the years I have learned many lessons from my mother. But one of the greatest lessons I have learned is the lesson of perseverance. My mother has survived a lot of unfortunate and, to some extent, unnecessary tragedy in her life. Yet she persevered. She stayed the course and she was able to do many great things, such as, move her family to a better place to provide them a chance to obtain better healthcare, better education, and more opportunities in life. She has also overcome her own personal battle of sickness, battling Type II Diabetes for over 20 years and now no longer suffers from the disease. She incorporated diet, exercise, and most of all perseverance to overcome this disease. She stayed the course. But before we get into that, let’s talk a little about how this “persevering mindset” was established. </p>
  
    <h2>THE &ldquo;PLOT&rdquo; THICKENS</h2>
    <p> In 1987 a representative of a non-profit agency called Cary Christian Center approached my mother and asked her if she would like to have a brick home built. At that time were living in an old “shotgun house” build by my great-grandfather. The plot of the “shot-gun house” was too small. In order to build the home, the agency explained to my mother that they would need access to the full plot. The “shot-gun house” was built on one-third of the total lot. The other two lots were occupied by two empty houses. If facing the lot, there was an empty house to the left of the “shot-gun house”; this one belonged to my great-grandfather. The house on the right of the “shotgun house” belonged to my grand aunt. And, of course our home, the “shot-gun house” was in the middle. The agency would need all three lots in order to build this new home for my mother. </p>
    
    <h2>HEIR-PROPERTY BLUES</h2>
    <p> Due to the laws pertaining heir-property, my mother had to consult with the other surviving members of the family who owned the land. She asked them if she could obtain sole ownership of the land and/or if she could have their permission to allow a home to be built by Cary Christian Center on her behalf. They told her no. (insert interview). A few weeks later, our family was visited by an aunt who lived in Omaha, Nebraska. Over dinner my mother told her about her current frustrations. My mother was also battling the medical issues surrounding her children. One child had skin condition, what turned out to be Lupus and her infant baby boy was born with yellow jaundice. My aunt from Omaha Nebraska encouraged my mother to move there in order to, at the least, get better medical attention. Frustrated and let down by the rejection from her family and the sickness of her children, my mother decided to move. </p>
    
    <h2>HEARTLAND HOME</h2>
    <p>March 1987, my mother, my two younger brothers, and me boarded a Greyhound bus headed for Omaha, Nebraska. It was a cool crisp day we arrived. I can remember seeing all the tall buildings of downtown Omaha. I thought we were in CHicago. When I think of where we came from...folks, it's been a very long journey to a place I never dreamt we would be. Yes, "The Heartland" is now home. But not for long, it is now my turn to take the reigns pave a new way. Omaha has been home for a lot of years, but in the near future we will embark on a new adventure.</p>
